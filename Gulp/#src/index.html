                    and how a digital advertising network may help.Recognition can be illustrated by two
                    individuals
                    entering a crowded room at a party. Both walkto the far side of the room, one of them slips
                    through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they
                    reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they
                    are
                    engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends
                    during
